# Descriptive Statistics Learning Insights

## Overview
I recently watched **Session 38 - Descriptive Statistics Part 1** from the CampusX YouTube channel as part of the DSMP 2023 series. Here are my key learnings:

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Population vs. Sample**: Understanding the difference and importance in statistical analysis.
- **Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics**: 
  - Descriptive: Summarizing and organizing data.
  - Inferential: Making predictions or inferences about a population.
- **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, Median, Mode.
- **Measures of Dispersion**: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation.
- **Graphs for Univariate Analysis**: Histograms, Box Plots, Pie Charts.
- **Graphs for Bivariate Analysis**: Scatter Plots, Correlation Graphs.

### What I Learned:
This session has given me a solid foundation in descriptive statistics, which is crucial for analyzing and interpreting data effectively. I look forward to applying these concepts in my future data science projects.

## Next Steps
- Continue learning more about inferential statistics.
- Apply these concepts in a project to solidify my understanding.
