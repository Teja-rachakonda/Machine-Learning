Applications of Probability in ML:--


Modeling Uncertainty: Quantify uncertainty in predictions (e.g., confidence intervals).
Data Generation: Simulate data based on probabilistic distributions.
Feature Selection: Use mutual information and entropy.
Regularization: Bayesian inference helps in understanding regularization techniques like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge).


Mutually Exclusive Events:--


Definition: Two events are mutually exclusive (or disjoint) if they cannot occur at the same time. In other words, the occurrence of one event excludes the possibility of the other.
Example: When flipping a coin, the events "heads" and "tails" are mutually exclusive.
Mathematically:
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
0
P(A∩B)=0
where 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B are mutually exclusive events.
Non-Mutually Exclusive Events
Definition: Two events are non-mutually exclusive if they can occur at the same time. The occurrence of one event does not exclude the possibility of the other.
Example: Drawing a card from a deck and getting a red card (event 
𝐴
A) and a king (event 
𝐵
B) are non-mutually exclusive because you can draw the king of hearts or king of diamonds.
Mathematically:
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
≠
0
P(A∩B)

=0
Additive Rule (Addition Rule of Probability)
Used to find the probability that at least one of two events will occur.
For Mutually Exclusive Events:
𝑃
(
𝐴
∪
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
+
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)
Since 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
0
P(A∩B)=0, there is no overlap between 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

For Non-Mutually Exclusive Events:
𝑃
(
𝐴
∪
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
+
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
−
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B)
The term 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
P(A∩B) is subtracted to avoid double-counting the probability of both events occurring.

Multiplicative Rule (Multiplication Rule of Probability)
Used to find the probability that two events will both occur.
For Independent Events:
Definition: Two events 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
×
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∩B)=P(A)×P(B)
For Dependent Events:
If 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B are dependent, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probability of 
𝐴
A and the conditional probability of 
𝐵
B given 
𝐴
A:
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
×
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
P(A∩B)=P(A)×P(B∣A)
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
P(B∣A) is the probability of 
𝐵
B occurring given that 
𝐴
A has occurred.
Summary:
Mutually Exclusive Events: Cannot occur together; 
𝑃
(
𝐴
∩
𝐵
)
=
0
P(A∩B)=0.
Non-Mutually Exclusive Events: Can occur together; 
𝑃

𝐴

𝐵
)
≠
0
P(A∩B)

=0.
Additive Rule: For calculating the probability of either 
𝐴

𝐵
B happening.
